Just walked out of Gap, and I'm... tired. Or was I tired before? Is it the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 or me? I don't know. This  , like, what was even going on half the time? And yeah, I might still love it? Don't ask me to unpack all that just yet. I mean, they really just throw you into it and let you float around, like one of those dream sequences where everyone's speaking French and you're in your pajamas. Who comes up with this stuff?

I can't decide if the lead character was annoying or absolutely brilliant. Like, come on, can we just have a moment without a slow-motion stare into the void every five minutes? I'm still seeing her face every time I blink. It's like she's living in my head rent-𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦 now, no eviction notice in sight. 

> And that soundtrack, holy mother, it's like someone decided to invite their five-year-old to play with a synth, mashed together with 90s grunge? Who does that in 2023? Oddly, it kinda worked. But why did I kinda like it? Oh yes, because I'm secretly a disaster person who enjoys chaos and mind games, apparently.

Then there was that scene... you know the one, with the boat? Or was it a bathtub? It might as well have been the same thing, floating on this metaphorical sea of nonsense. Felt like I was stuck in a Kafka novel but with more colorful outfits. I think my brain was short-circuiting by the end. And the dialogue was worthwhile, if you’re fluent in cryptic metaphors. Like, what's that supposed to mean, really?

Here's this random thought: the ending, is it supposed to mean something deeper? Or did the writers just throw their scripts in the air and go, “yep, that’ll do”? I swear, it's like a recipe for a pumpkin pie but you're only given potatoes. 

```cpp
int escapePlotTwist(int confusion) {
    return confusion  42; // why does this feel oddly accurate to the  's logic?
}
```

But you know what —even after all this, I'd still probably 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   just to hear that weird mix again. Maybe 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   with the 𝘴𝘶𝘣𝘵𝘪𝘵𝘭𝘦s off, see if it helps. Or maybe it’ll all make a miraculous bit of sense when I'm not running on coffee fumes and a sleepless night. Or not. Maybe that's the point? Why do I have so many questions... what did I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩?
